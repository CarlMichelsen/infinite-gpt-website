## How to run

Install NodeJS and get an openAI api key.
Make a ".env" file and add it to the root of this project (next to the ".env-example" file)
The only required configuration value in ".env" is "GPT-TOKEN", set this to the openAI API key.

Do "npm install" from root folder.

To run in dev mode with nodemon do "npm run dev"

To build normally do "npm run build"
To run after the build do "npm run start"
